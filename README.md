The `Data` directory contains 3 `JSON` and 3 `Python3` files used to populate Firebase. Before running the scripts, ensure that `firebase.json` is replaced with yours downloaded from the `Firebase Console`. Also, edit the file `firebaseurl.txt` to your Firebase's URL from the `Firebase Console`.

- `Python3 Scripts`
  - `InsertBusRoutes.py` is used to populate Firebase at the `/BusRoutes` reference. It contains all the bus *routes* as well as the *time taken* to travel to the next busstop.
  - `InsertBusStops.py` is used to populate Firebase at the `/BusStops` reference. It contains all the bus stop's *Name*, *NextBusAlias* (used to query for bus arrival timings) and *Services* (used to determine the bus services at each bus stop).
  - `InsertVenue.py` is used to populate Firebase at the `/Venues` reference. It contains all the venue's *Name*, *Latitude*, *Longitude* and *IsBusStop* (used to determine if a venue is a bus stop).

- `JSON Files`
  - `BusRoutes.json` contains the bus *routing information* and *time taken* to each stop.
  - `BusStop.json` contains the bus stop's *Name*, *NextBusAlias* and *Services*.
  - `Venue List.json` contains the venue's *Name*, *Latitude*, *Longitude* and *IsBusStop*.
